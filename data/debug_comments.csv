"I joined a new league this year and they have different scoring rules than I'm used to. It's a slight PPR league- .2 PPR. Standard besides 1 points for 15 yards receiving, .2 points per completion, 6 points per TD thrown, and some bonuses for rec/rush/pass yardage. My question is, is it wildly clear that QB has the highest potential for points? I put in the rules at a ranking site and noticed that top QBs had 300 points more than the top RB/WR. Would it be dumb not to grab a QB in the first round?"
"In your scenario, a person could just not run the mandatory background check on the buyer and still sell the gun to the felon. There's no way to enforce it. An honest seller is going to not sell the gun to them when they see they're a felon on the background check. A dishonest seller isn't going to run the check in the first place. No one is going to be honest enough to run the check, see they're a felon, and then all of a sudden immediately turn dishonest and say ""nah, you know what, here's your gun anyway."" They wouldn't run the fucking check in the first place, genius. Your bullshit proposal is **NOT ENFORCEABLE**. This is why people without 

&gt;Here's an idea, why not make a background check system where it would be illegal to sell guns to felons? That doesn't convince you? IDGAF.

We already fucking have that. What aren't you understanding about this?! It's just currently not available to private sellers. I'd like to make it available, but there's no point in making it mandatory.

&gt;You're just supporting it to make a gesture towards background check reform in bad faith.

As a gun owner who has harmed no one and has constitutionally protected rights, I actually don't own the anti-gun side a damn thing. It's people like you that convince me to not give an inch at all. I'm wiling to extend NICS to private sellers as voluntary. Take it or leave it, because it isn't going to be made mandatory. Not gonna happen. Period."
"They don't get paid for how much time you spend building your army. They get paid when you gem it. Having a premade layout saves what, 30 seconds? During that time they've made $0 and still have the ability to make $X if you decide to gem it. "
"I dunno, back before the August update in an A+ lobby for Tower Control in Saltspray Rig, I remember the enemy team barraging us with bombs in a suspiciously coordinated fashion.  And my teammates were also tossing bombs left and right.  Non-stop splat/suction/burst bombs.  Bombs, bombs fucking everywhere.  It was terrifying having to dodge one after the other.  It never ended, and some of them even had bomb rush to toss even more goddamn bombs.

I think I still have PTSD of that horrifying event.  That match really felt like a Michael Bay movie."
"No, but Toriyama sometimes would draw himself as a little robot. Shen was a funny character for a few episodes(hitting Yamcha in the junk) before you find out his true identity. Then he has an awesome fight with Piccolo."
"Implement some form of tenure for mods and require a majority vote to remove any tenured mod. Only allow mods to trigger a removal vote on mods lower than them in the hierarchy however.

This removes the possibility of a single mod (such as an absentee top mod) swooping in and blowing up the sub but doesn't create opportunities for hijacking. Importantly, it also doesn't require rejiggering the existing mod hierarchies or ongoing admin involvement in dispute resolution."
"I hate reading shit like this because you sound like such a catch before or after you started working out, and your husband takes you for granted.  What I would do to be with someone like you.  I'm not going to tell you to stay or go but whichever you decide, just don't lose sight of how you deserve to be treated and don't put up with anything less."
"&gt;Baltimore County prosecutors will speak to the victim's family before deciding whether to charge Shattuck, reports the station.

Earlier the parents said: 

&gt;""What she did to my son is heinous. The fact that she paraded her pedophilia in front of her own son is even more disturbing,"" the mother said. ""Any adult who rapes a child deserves to be in prison. Please hold her accountable.""

It seems like they probably will ask that they send her to prison. I hope they do. Honestly that judge basically gave the green light to any adult woman to molest little boys free of consequence in the future and that's simply not acceptable.

"I think you might be missing my point. A gun is a tool which allows you to kill very efficiently. Not having those around means there's less chance for people to make dumb decisions which end up in deaths. I'm not concerned with spree killers or other people who plan to kill, I'm concerned with people who wouldn't otherwise put other's lives at risk when they get angry, but there's a gun at hand. The latter is vastly more common than the former."
"Thank you for the Giveaway OP! I would like to enter for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

"Im Dutch and have watched all Netherlands games for the last few years, Nigel de Jong has been solid during the WC and before and I see no reason at all not to include him since we don't have any non attacking midfielders in our team other then Anita (which I don't really rate) and Blind (who we'll probably need as LB). Tete hasn't even been that good in the eredivisie IMO, so why put him ahead of a expierenced player in the Dutch squad like Janmaat is beyond me.  We don't have a real LB in the squad, only Blind and Kongolo (who didn't play well in a weak eredivisie last season) so that's why I would include Pieters.
   I'm not making assumptions here. I agree that our defense hasn't been that good, that's why I don't get why we don't use Nigel de Jong, that's why I wouldn't use young unexpierenced players like Riedewald and Tete. These matches are super important, we won't qualify if we don't win them, so if you want to experiment with other players I would always use more expierenced players and not players who played with each other before instead of new ones like Tete, Riedewald and Anita. "
"Don't


Just take them before/after.


I take PreparE before going out and RecoverE on the come down and my rolls have always been pleasant and my comedowns minimal.  Both can be found on [ravesafer.com](http://www.ravesafer.com)


If you really must take some in with you, the PreparE pack only has 3 pills in it (all of the supplements are combined into these 3 pills), so it's far easier to get them into places than having all the supplements separately.

"&gt; Key word there is ""were"". As I nodded to when I said ""Yeah, back in 1960"".

Which is what I referred to. I pointed out the *history* of the use of nullification logic.

&gt;Guess what? This isn't 1960. It's 2015, 

And so what? So people don't have bad idea? A bigot won't use the same logic to refuse to convict? If it is OK to say ""I won't convict on a drug charge"" it is OK to say ""I won't convict on a rape charge"".

&gt;you're playing on a stereotype from nearly 60 years ago as if it were a true today.

And you have completely misunderstood what I wrote and my point."
"&gt; I'd really like to see if anyone has ever used it.

[Here's](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/indiana-law-force-cops-overturned-mans-battery-officer-charge/) a case where a man slamming his house's door against an officer's foot was deemed legal because the officer didn't have probable cause to investigate his house.

&gt; But the appeals court reasoned that, “Constable Webb had entered Cupello’s apartment without consent, probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or exigent circumstances. Because Constable Webb resisted Cupello’s subsequent attempts to close the door, Cupello had a reasonable belief that force was necessary to terminate Constable Webb’s unlawful entry into his apartment.”"
"Shane o'mac vs Brock Lesnar 

No DQ

Obviously Shane would have to be younger and this would be first run  Brock when he wasn't being pushed as basically unstoppable

"I don't see anything like that on the wiring diagram.  Doesn't mean its not there but I never heard of it.  The first gen bikes have and accessory wire in the fairing that can be used for low draw devices like a cell phone or gps. 

Installing a 12v outlet isn't very difficult.  Are you used to working on bikes or with electric wires at all? "
"I think *M* is one of the most interesting early sound films. Fritz Lang really made incredible use of sound, especially for a director who had predominantly done silent films at the time. Much of the film is completely silent which adds to the suspense for me and the anxiety that the film creates. There's never really a wasted sound clip, every line of dialogue is extremely important. Even Peter Lorre's whistling is integral to the plot."
"This is Zen as it is found outside of /r/zen. Zen flesh, zen bones. This place doesn't fill bellies the same way.

"The game is very good, but the style of it doesn't lead to paying attention to the storyline or the environment. Which is a fault of the game as it doesn't reward you in game with anything for exploring, except small acknowledgements. "

"I recommend [Intimacy and Desire](http://amzn.com/0825306299) by David Schnarch.  An excellent read, and a very thorough discussion of the problem of unequal desire in long term relationships.

[Mating in Captivity](http://amzn.com/0060753641) is also very good, but focuses more on lack of desire rather than unequal desire."
No. PL has more teams in Europe than Italy = PL teams can make more points than Serie A teams. PL will only lose its 4th CL spot if all English teams lose and all Italian teams reach Semifinals/Finals. So: No.

People don't just build them without knowing anything. We get into it after months of reading about cube building theory, reading lists, etc. Start along that road. "
"Yeah, no. That's not the way politics work. You don't elect someone who has no plan and then pray that he'll figure out a way to get it done once he's in office. You're basically electing someone on a promise they may or may not keep, which I thought was what Sanders' campaign was against. At least candidates like Clinton or Bush have the political muscle to get what they say done. "
"I think this is something that escapes a lot of people.  It's not about who was in the right or who was in the wrong, it comes down to everyone staying safe and going home in one piece at the end of the day."

Espionage: Your spies become more effective in nations influenced by you culturally. They will take only one turn to establish surveillance in their cities. Higher influence status also makes them operate as if they had already been promoted.

Conquest: When you capture a city belonging to an enemy influenced by you, Resistance in that city will last in fewer turns. Also, the city will lose fewer citizens upon capturing."
"Love that song. Maybe it's just me being weird (spoiler alert: it is), but I always imagine the narrator in that song singing it to himself. Or even, it's a buddhist-type thing and the it's the concept of ""you"" itself that's bad and needs to die.

I like to think too much :)"

"He's actually very fun to play as if you understand the game. he also has counterplay, but people like yourself are too ignorant to figure that out and instead just say he's badly designed just because you dont put any thought into it.

Truth is Yorick is well balanced, he's just old and unpopular. thats why he's last on the rework table; because he isnt detrimental to the game and not enough people play this champ."
"The thing is that third-tier classes weren't really any different than the second-tier versions they replaced. They just hamstrung the second-tier versions a bit and boosted the stat caps, reserving things like signature skills or a second weapon type for third-tier instead."
"The Centra players agreed to this last season, and had no problems with it when it was played through. 

It basically becomes Midwest vs. Northeast/Europe for Radius. Sphere is West vs Southeast. And Origin is whoever can play on it best. It works out.

"Yea, but if it does ridiculous amount of damage guaranteed, which it will, then, if you haven't won the game with that drop you will win with speedlings. It worked too reliably, there wasn't enough incentive to not do it."
"Whenever I see what would normally be a good deal advertised to me, I just dismiss it as a scam. In my mind at least, every single ad I see is a scam.

"I was in the same boat, I'm going into first year uni now and felt left out when most of my friends had their license. I remember I was scared as hell as the test date was approaching because I didn't want to fail and most of my friends got their license first trial too. What helped me was a lot of practice, I used to get my dad to take me driving for hours multiple times a week and get really comfortable driving. So when I did my test, all my anxiety and nervousness was gone because I was so comfortable with driving at this point. Good  luck!"

"Verratti is a great enforcer. Vidal is enough of a player to dominate a midfield the way Iniesta can't. 

What I am saying is that each and every team bar Pep's Barça had to rely on a strong physical midfielder to win. Busquets, Marchisio, Pogba, Rakitic are strong, they are not small, elegant technical players. The big discussion was about Arsenal - and Arsenal don't have that physically imposing midfielder other teams do"
"It's why these ""roles"" that Smite have are really fucking annoying when more unique gods enter the game. Dota technically has roles but everyone ignores them and plays each specific hero to the best of their ability, buying the items that work best for that hero and putting them in the lane that benefits them and their team the most. Smite  gods are lumped in the different pools where roughly the same items are bought, with roughly the same playstyle and are put in roughly the same lanes, with few exceptions."

"I was at a camp for a few days, so I apologize that this is so late, but if you haven't already found out yet, slacker is an online radio service, kind of like Pandora or something, from what I understand.

There are subreddits for both Townsville and Cairns so you can get some specific information from there as well as printed guides like LP.

"Quick google shows that these are most of the [soul effects](http://www.basilmarket.com/forum/2815322/0/Gms_Soul_Weapon_Compilation_Thread.html). It's all dependent on what kind of effect you want really. In terms of summoning or buffing. I prefer summons since they actually do really decent damage and clear maps very well if you have an acceptable range. Therefore, Murgoth is probably the best summoned soul or magnificent Magnus (which is also a summon). Prefixes usually determine what type of stat they will have. So for example A **clever** ""soul"" will provide the int stat or a **potent** ""soul"" will provide attack damage. Specifically for a xenon you probably want a **flashy** soul since it gives an all stats boost if you can't manage to find/buy a magnificent soul."

The think that gets me is that you posted here asking if your knife was worth $300.00, your friends told you it wasn't, I told you it wasn't and explained why, and you get all huffy about it.  If you don't want the opinion of people more knowledgeable than yourself, then you shouldn't ask for it.  "
